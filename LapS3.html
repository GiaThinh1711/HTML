<div id="profile"><p>Date of birth: 17/11/2002</p>
    <p>Role: Instrument</p>
    <p>It's been a long day without you, my friend
    And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
        We've come a long way from where we began
        Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again</p>
    <p>When I see you again
    Damn, who knew?
    All the planes we flew, good things we've been through
    That I'll be standing right here
    Talking to you 'bout another path
        I know we loved to hit the</p> <p>road and laugh
        But something told me that it wouldn't last
    Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
        Those were the days, hard work forever pays not see you when better</p>
    <p>Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
            Uh
    How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
    Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side</p>
